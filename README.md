NP BOUTIQUE
I have created a website for a small business called NP Boutique which was established in 2024. The business focuses on affordable, high quality trendy clothes for women and men. The website will allow the business to grow and gain popularity, which will help grow the number of customers. NP Boutique started with just selling few products, now they sell more than 30 items per day and they aim to have a growing online presence in other countries.
HOMEPAGE
On the website homepage there are high quality visually appealing images, showcasing what the business is about. There is also a search bar that will help customers discover products they are looking for easily such as sales, new arrival, cart. The homepage also has a shop page which categories the clothes into women and men section.

The Homepage also has a business logo

The logo consists of letters “NP” which stands for Ntsako Praiseweath which is the owner or founder of the business. The logo is black with a white background which represents professionalism and sophistication, it also represents exclusivity meaning customers can express themselves through fashion and they play a role in completing their own style journey. The logo also represents beauty and elegancy. Lastly the theme (black and white) represents simplicity and class.
Homepage has a subscription newsletter where customers get 15% off their first order or purchase when they signup using their email to receive latest fashion trends the business has to offer.
